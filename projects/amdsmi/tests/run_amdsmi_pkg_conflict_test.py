run_amdsmi_pkg_conflict_test.py
================================

Sanity-check that the system-package shared object and the pip wheel's
bundled shared object ship under DIFFERENT SONAMEs, so a process that
somehow has both installed cannot accidentally double-load the same
library and crash during static C++ initialisation.

This is the only multi-package invariant we still validate. amd-smi
follows an "either you install the rpm/deb OR you install the wheel"
model -- the loader in py-interface/amdsmi_wrapper.py picks one .so
based solely on whether libamd_smi_python.so sits next to the wrapper
file, with no path-walking, no env-var ladders, and no .pth tricks.

Run it from inside a freshly-built tree where both artifacts exist:
    /opt/rocm/lib/libamd_smi.so.<MAJOR>           (system rpm/deb)
    <build>/.../libamd_smi_python.so.<MAJOR>      (wheel)
